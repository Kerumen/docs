How does it work? You will be able to connect your bot to multiple channels with our tool named **Bot Connector**.
Bot Connector takes care of receiving all messages and transfers it to your bot in a uniform way.

Go to the Connect tab and toggle the channel you want to connect your bot in the list.
Follow the instruction to configure the channel.
You will need to have an account on these other platforms in order to get the necessary tokens.

Now each time Bot Connector receives a message from the channel, it will automatically interact with your bot skills from the Build tab, and respond accordingly.
