## Select predefined skills

You can choose one or several predefined skills you want to use as a starting point.
You are free to modify them if you don't like them as such, or even delete them once you're ready to make your own.

If you want to fork them later on, they are available here: [https://recast.ai/scaffolder/starter-skills](https://recast.ai/scaffolder/starter-skills)
